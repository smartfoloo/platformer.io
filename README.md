## FAQ

#### All of the links are blocked.

You can make your own custom link by either froking this repo and adding a custom domain, or use a cloud hosting solution such as Netlify and Vercel. The links are on the **Deployment** Section.

#### Did you make these games?

No, I did not. These games are made by different game developers. Thank you so much for your contribution.

#### Can you add this game to the site?

You can request a game on our site under Extras. Remember, your game may not be added at all. BTW, stop requesting for Roblox, Shell Shockers, Fortnite, Minecraft, or Valorant. It's not possible for me to get code for those games.

#### Please give me mod!!!!

No, we do not have any open spots for moderator. Sorry:)
